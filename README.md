# rust-quale

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/quale/)

A Rust port of the `which` utility. Locates an executable in the user’s path.

‘Quale’ is an Italian translation of the English word ‘which’.

*Note: rust-quale currently only works on Unix-like operating systems.*

## Usage

[dependencies]
quale = "1.0"
```

```rust
extern crate quale;

use quale::which;

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(
        which("sh"),
        Some("/bin/sh".into()));

    assert_eq!(
        which("foobar"),
        None);
}
```
